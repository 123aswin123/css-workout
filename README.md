Look Mom, I can position stuff with CSS!
======================================

CSS positioning was always a nightmare, that peak has been summited today thanks to [freeCodeCamp's CSS Grid Tutorial](freecodecamp.org)

If you are on the same boat as I am where you've done very minimal UI design code, 
Do yourself a favour and learn Grid, it takes 1 hour tops  and your positioning woes will magically disappear.
